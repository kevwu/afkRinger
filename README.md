# AFK Ringer #

The AFK Ringer is a very simple Minecraft plugin that allows users to send client-side sounds to players that are AFK.

## Usage ##
- `/ring [player]` to send a note block piano tone.
- `/ring [player] effect]` to use a different noise in place of the note block tone.
- Available effects are: ghast, thunder, cave, click, creeper, explosion, burp, vwoop, piano and glass.

## Planned features: ##
- Only players that are actually AFK (according to the Essentials plugin) can be sent sounds.
- Players wishing to send sounds must wait for a cooldown time before they can send another sound to prevent the abuse of the ringer as an annoyance.
- Have the sound effect repeat for a short duration or until the recipient comes out of AFK.
- Place the recipient into a (client-side) box.
